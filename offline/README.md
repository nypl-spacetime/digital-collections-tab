# Scripts and data for offline use

Digital Collections Tab connects with NYPL’s [brick-by-brick](https://github.com/nypl-spacetime/brick-by-brick) instance to load a random image—and prompts users to geotag this image in [Surveyor](http://spacetime.nypl.org/surveyor).

If for some reason brick-by-brick is offline, Digital Collections Tab uses the data from this directory instead.

Running `index.js` creates the files needed.
